/* run_command serves the purposes of running terminal commands
   within both linux and windows environments.
   We use this for dmesg, dmidecode, and systeminfo.
   
   run_command() takes three parameters: cmd, detphrase, and dp_length.
   cmd is the command to run such as systeminfo or dmesg or dmidecode
   
   detphrase is the string to check for within the command. If we run
   dmidecode and we're looking for "VMWARE", the detphrase is "VMWARE".
   
   dp_length is the length of the string we want to specify. This allows
   us to take substrings of the system output in order to have cleaner, 
   more readable code. 
   
   The benefits of using this run_command() function over a system() call
   is that it allows us to save the output of system calls as well as take
   substrings.
